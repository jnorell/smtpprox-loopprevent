smtpprox is a trivial transparent SMTP proxy, an SMTP server and
client combination. It uses its own SMTP server and client modules
which are designed to expose every step of the protocol dialogue to
the calling program, which provides for the greatest flexibility in
hooking in envelope and content controls and scanning.

For efficiency reasons, it pre-forks and serves from a pool of
servers, Apache-style.
